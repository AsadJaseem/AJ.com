Samsung was founded as a grocery trading store on March 1, 1938, by Lee Byung-Chull. He started his business in Taegu, Korea, trading noodles and other goods produced in and around the city and exporting them to China and its provinces. (The company name, Samsung, came from the Korean for �three stars.�)

Buying a new smartphone can be exciting, but switching to an entirely different mobile ecosystem? For many people, that’s just plain terrifying.

Mobile devices have become such an important part of our work and social lives that there’s understandably some reluctance to change brands due to the perception that transitioning all those apps, subscriptions, contacts, files and photos might cause havoc.

Switching your phone brand of choice today isn’t as difficult as you might think or as time-consuming as it used to be. Free services like Samsung Smart Switch handle all the leg work, and virtually all of the top business and consumer apps support both major platforms. As a result, replacing an iPhone with a Samsung Galaxy device is just as seamless as upgrading from an older Galaxy to the latest Galaxy S23 series or Galaxy Z series release.<br><br><br>

If you’re an iPhone user who may be due for an upgrade, here’s a list of 23 reasons to make the switch to Samsung this time around. Keep in mind that businesses can take advantage of special offers, volume pricing, bulk trade-in opportunities and free shipping with a Samsung Business Account.<br><br><br>
